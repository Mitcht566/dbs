Core Systems
Stats & Attributes
Stats: STR (Strength), DEX (Dexterity), CON (Constitution), WIL (Willpower), KI (Ki), MND (Mind).
Stat limits: Each stat can go up to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1e24) using double (float) values, with proper formatting (no scientific notation).
Attributes: Health, Stamina, Energy. Not visible on the character sheet, only shown as colored bars (red/green/blue) at the top-left UI.
Virtual Attributes: Attack Damage, Defense, Ki Damage, Skill Points. Not shown in the HUD, only visible on the character sheet GUI.
Stat-to-Attribute Conversion:
+1 CON = +5 Health, +5 Stamina
+1 KI = +10 Energy
+1 STR = +1.5 Attack Damage
+1 DEX = +1.5 Defense
+1 WIL = +1.5 Ki Damage
+1 MND = +1 Skill Point (used for skills/transformations)
UI
Stat bars at top left: Health (red), Stamina (green), Energy (blue).
Character Sheet GUI: Shows stats and virtual attributes, not real attributes.
Number formatting for ultra-large numbers (e.g., 1.53T instead of scientific notation).
Overflow prevention for stat bars/boxes, no negative numbers, never render scientific notation, and no integer overflow.
Transformation System
Transformations: Unlockable under certain conditions (PL, Mind, etc.), stat changes apply per transformation.
Saiyan and Bio Android: Can unlock Super Saiyan (before semi-perfect for Bio Androids). Requirement: PL ≥ 3,000,000 and Mind ≥ 1,000 for Bio Androids, cost in Mind points.
Transformation Activation: Keybind (e.g., V), 10-second transformation time.
Aura Rendering: Racial/Transform aura color and brightness changes (yellow for SSJ, lighter yellow for SSJ4, etc.).
Race-Specific Features
Arcosian
Forms: Suppressed, Second Form, Third Form, all unlocked from the start.
Base: 250 CON, 50 STR, 50 DEX, 40 WIL, 50 KI, MND unchanged.
Suppressed: 30 CON, 10 STR, 10 DEX, 15 WIL, 30 KI
Second: 50 CON, 20 STR, 20 DEX, 15 WIL, 30 KI
Third: 70 CON, 30 STR, 30 DEX, 20 WIL, 40 KI
Namekian
Giant Form: Player model 3x size, all stats x2. Unlockable by Namekians.
Namekian NPCs: Power level 2,800–3,200. Player can fuse with up to 5, gaining the sum of their stats/power level.
Fusion: Stat sum added directly to player stats on fusion.
Bio Android
Super Saiyan access: Can unlock prior to semi-perfect form with the above requirements.
Imperfect (base), Semi-Perfect, Perfect forms: Each with their own stat multipliers.
Absorb Skill: Uses 1/8 the energy Androids use, but Bio Androids use energy for running/flying/ki attacks, with normal energy regen.
Android
Base stats: 250 CON, 50 STR, 50 DEX, 40 WIL, 50 KI, 10 MND.
Absorb Skill: Uses energy, but Androids do not regenerate energy naturally.
Energy & Combat Systems
Ki Charge Keybind: (C) Restores 2.5% energy per second. Shows colored aura (by race/transform).
Aura Color:
Humans/Bio-Androids: White
Saiyans: Very light white-blue
Arcosians: Very light purple
Namekians: Very light greenish white
Super Saiyan/Grade 2/3: Yellow
Super Saiyan 4: Lighter yellow
Stat Progression & Training
TP (Training Points) System:
Gain TP: 1 TP per air punch (no damage), or more with training/weighted clothing/gravity.
Stat Upgrade Cost: Starts at 10 TP, increases with level (TP Cost = Base × (Multiplier)^(Level-1), level up every 100 stat upgrades).
Weighted Clothing:
Custom enchantment (applies to any armor, via command), levels 1–250 (each level = +50kg).
+0.25 TP per air punch, +0.5 TP per entity hit per 50kg, stacks with multiple armor pieces.
Gravity Device:
Block that sets gravity (up to 10,000x) in a 20-block radius.
Tougher gravity requires higher power levels to survive:
10x needs PL ≥ 5,000

20x needs PL ≥ 10,000

30x needs PL ≥ 15,000

40x needs PL ≥ 20,000

100x needs PL ≥ 50,000

Insufficient PL: movement/fly speed -1/4, punch speed -1/8 (or -1/2 and -1/4 past 100x), risk of death.
TP gain: 2.5 TP per punch in gravity, +0.25 for each gravity multiplier (2x = 2.75, 3x = 3.0, etc).
